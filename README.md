# City Boys Dynasty

Fantasy football league app prototype — matchups, standings, rosters, a mock
draft room, free agency, and a simulated live-scoring week clock.

## Running it

**Just want to look at it?** Open `dist/index.html` — it is the whole app in one
self-contained file, so double-clicking it works. Rebuild it with `npm run build`
after changing anything under `css/` or `js/`.

**Working on the code?** The source is plain ES modules, which browsers refuse to
load over `file://`, so it needs to be served:

```
npm start          # serves the repo at http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

No framework and no runtime dependencies; `esbuild` is only used to produce the
single-file build, and `playwright` only for the verification harness.

### Fonts

The typefaces are embedded as base64 `@font-face` rules in `css/fonts.css`, so
the app renders identically with no network at all. It previously linked
fonts.googleapis.com, which meant the design only appeared online — offline,
every `font-family:'Oswald'` rule (78 of them, none with a fallback) dropped to
the browser's default serif and the whole app changed character. Every family
now carries a fallback too, so a miss degrades to a condensed sans rather than
Times. Regenerate with `node tools/fetch-fonts.mjs` after changing the type.

## Arc Markets

The **Markets** item in the bottom nav opens Arc Markets — a separate section, not
another fantasy screen. It takes over the whole phone with its own header, its own
blue palette, its own bottom nav and its own `localStorage` key
(`arc_markets_v1`). "Leagues" in its nav returns to the fantasy app.

The code boundary matches the product boundary: `js/markets/` imports only from
`js/data/` (plain NFL facts — players, teams, colours) and never touches league
settings, rosters, lineups or scoring. The only seam is `openMarkets()`, which
adds a class to `<body>`.

**The pricing model** comes from the concept brief: a contract settles on the
player's official season production at **100 points per dollar**, so a player
projected for 328 points prices near $3.28 and pays out their real total ÷ 100 at
season end. Prices are therefore derived from real projections rather than copied
from the mockups, which keeps the whole market internally consistent. Day moves,
trade counts and sparklines are seeded from each player's id, so the numbers are
stable across reloads and screenshots.

Deliberately *not* faked: the News and History tabs are empty states rather than
invented headlines about real players.

`npm run check:markets` drives the section through 23 interaction checks. Several
assert *geometry*, not just DOM, because both bugs found here were invisible to
content assertions: a body state class that collided with the sheet element's own
class (applying `position:absolute; transform:translateY(102%)` to `<body>` and
sliding the app off screen), and a `.face` rule scoped so narrowly that a face
used outside a card or row rendered its headshot at full natural size. The check
also fakes a successful headshot load, so layout is tested the way a user with a
working network sees it.

## MLS League Office

`mls/index.html` is a second self-contained page, unrelated to the football
app: it tracks a FIFA/EA FC MLS career-mode league against its own house rules.
Open it directly — no build step, no server, no imports from `js/`.

It does three jobs, one per tab:

**Squad.** A registered-squad table (name, age, nationality, role, wage, MLS
regen) checked live against the franchise's quotas — the $175K wage cap rising
$5K a season, the 35-player limit, at least 18 North Americans, and the
per-franchise South America / Europe / Rest-of-world ceilings. Nationalities map
to zones by confederation, so CONCACAF counts as North America.

The interesting part is the exemption slots — New York's +3 Italians, Canada's
+3 French speakers, Texas's +2 Spain and +1 France, and so on. Slots are filled
*eagerly* and pressure-first: each slot goes to the matching player whose zone
sits furthest over its cap. Filling them lazily would be just as legal and much
less useful — three Italians left uncounted make Europe read 5/5 when five
places are actually free. Slots are never spent on a North American, because
that zone is a floor rather than a ceiling and exempting one would quietly cost
the squad an 18th.

**Transfers.** Window allowances (3 starters + 3 bench in summer, 1 + 1 in
January), the one decline a season, and the point where three starters out
makes declines free again. The offer desk takes four answers — player, role,
buying club's country, window — and returns the ruling: must accept, may
decline, not transferable, or a genuine rule collision that needs a league call.
Recording a sale drops the player from the registered squad so the compliance
panel stays honest.

**Draft.** Months scouted set the round (7–9 → 1st, 4–6 → 2nd, 1–3 → 3rd). Pick
entitlements roll forward across seasons, because an extra pick in a round costs
the next round this season *and* the same round next season; a best player sold
to a top-five country adds a free third-rounder. Seasons are walked in order
from the first, since each one's debts are the next one's starting position.

The Rulebook tab carries the rules as written plus every reading the engine
acts on — what "over 32" means, which caps an exempt slot relieves, what happens
when a mandatory sale lands in a full window. The franchise quota table there is
generated from the same `FRANCHISES` object the engine enforces, so it cannot
drift.

State lives in one `localStorage` key (`mls_league_office_v1`) and moves between
browsers as copy-and-paste JSON rather than a file download — artifact viewers
have downloads blocked, and the clipboard works everywhere.

Fonts come from Google here rather than being embedded as they are in the
football app; every family carries a real fallback stack, so the page holds its
shape offline.

## Layout

```
index.html      markup only
css/            one stylesheet per screen area, linked in cascade order
js/
  main.js       entry point: module order, window bridge, boot sequence
  state.js      the handful of values shared across modules
  store.js      localStorage persistence, roster rows, image downscaling
  data/         teams, league config, NFL player/schedule/colour tables
  markets/      Arc Markets — self-contained, see above
  *.js          one module per screen or subsystem
tools/          dev server and the verification harness
```

### How startup works

`js/main.js` imports every module in the order the original single-file script
ran them, then copies their exports onto `window` — the markup drives the app
through inline `onclick="..."` handlers, which resolve against the global scope.

Modules do no work at import time. Anything that used to run at the top level
(seeding the store, applying league defaults, painting the sidebar rail) now
lives in an `init*` function that `main.js` calls in order. This matters:
ES modules evaluate depth-first over the import graph, which does *not* match
source order, and the original code depended on source order.

### `js/state.js`

Nine values are rebound from a module other than the one that declared them.
An imported binding is read-only in ES modules, so those live as properties on
a single exported `S` object. Everything else stays module-local.

## The draft room

Sleeper's layout on purpose: owners across, rounds down, snaking, the whole
draft visible, tiles tinted by position. Density is deliberately unchanged — the
additions are metadata and history, not a new interface.

**On the clock** — the owner's column carries a timer above it, a tinted header
and a soft pulse on the pending cell. Nothing moves; it just becomes obvious.

**Badges** sit tiny in a tile corner and are configurable per league in
`draft-meta.js`: auto pick, clutch (submitted under a threshold, default 5s),
reach and steal (a threshold either side of ADP). Icons are swappable, each
badge can be turned off, and they are computed from the stored pick rather than
saved, so changing a threshold re-reads history rather than rewriting it.

**Reactions** are the point. Hold any tile to react; one per league member,
changeable until the next pick lands, then locked forever. Tiles show the top
three as bubbles along the bottom edge, tapping those opens the full breakdown,
and the whole thing is stored with the pick — so reopening a draft years later
still shows what the league said on the night. Holding rather than tapping keeps
the draft workflow intact: the common action stays one tap, and reacting is a
deliberate gesture that can't fire while scanning the board.

Each pick record is `{ id, ts, ms, auto, react }`. Older saves held bare id
strings; `migrateDraft()` lifts them on load.

## The live week and Rewind

`LIVE_WEEK` names the week that is currently being played; the user's own
matchup takes its score from the running lineup total rather than the seeded
schedule, and starters lock as their kickoffs pass.

Tapping either win % or the win bar opens **Rewind** — a win-probability chart
across the whole NFL week, 50% on the midline, the area filled green while you
lead and red once you trail. Scrub it to read the time, the score and the odds
at that moment; white dots mark scoring plays.

The axis only covers time when games are running. Kickoff windows are merged and
everything between them is dropped — no Saturday if nobody plays Saturday, no
Sunday morning, no Monday daytime before the night game. Dead hours would
otherwise be most of the chart: a week is about 7,500 minutes and only a third
of it has a ball in the air. For a drafted week that is 135 samples across five
windows instead of 744 across the whole calendar.

The series comes from the lineup rather than being drawn: each player's game has
a kickoff, their points land in two to four deterministic jumps across it, and
the chart samples every ten minutes **plus a point at the exact minute of every
scoring play**, so a score is never rounded onto the nearest tick. Those points
carry the scorer and the points gained, which is what the readout shows — a
typical week has ~46 scoring points, most of them off the ten-minute grid.
Dots are coloured by side: green for your players, red for the opponent's. That is what gives the line its shape —
flat overnight, jagged on Sunday afternoon when games overlap. Odds come from `winProbability(edge, rem)` in `js/clock.js`, shared with the
live hero so the two never disagree. `edge` is the expected-points margin,
`rem` the points still to be played — the uncertainty the margin is measured
against. As the last game ends `rem` reaches zero and the function returns an
exact 0 or 100, because by then the result is simply known. The previous
straight-line formula clamped at 1–99 and so never resolved.

Both were unreachable for a while: `LIVE_WEEK` was `0` while weeks run from
`MINW` (1), so `week === LIVE_WEEK` could never be true. The hero stayed at
0.0-0.0 however far the clock was stepped, and Rewind interpolated between
zeroes. The matchup screen had a second copy of the same mistake in its
`canRewind` check, which left the scrubber wired up only in the detail view.

## Verifying changes

The app is deterministic — no `Math.random`, no `Date.now` — so it can be
diffed against itself exactly.

```
npm start                                     # in one shell
npm run snapshot                              # dumps DOM for 32 interactions
node tools/pixel-diff.mjs <url-a> <url-b>     # screenshot comparison
```

`tools/snapshot.mjs` drives the app through every view and writes the resulting
DOM to one file per step. Diff two runs to see exactly what a change altered.

`tools/pixel-diff.mjs` compares rendered pixels. Three things had to be
controlled before it gave trustworthy answers, and all three produced convincing
false alarms first:

1. **Remote assets.** Player headshots and webfonts load from nfl.com and Google.
   When they are unreachable, each broken-image placeholder appears whenever its
   request happens to fail, so two runs of the *same* build disagree. The tool
   now aborts non-local requests up front to make that failure deterministic.
2. **The pulse animation.** The live-score dot loops every 1.8s, so its phase
   tracks wall-clock time. Animations and transitions are frozen before capture.
3. **Toasts.** They are `setTimeout`-driven; `#hint` is hidden before capture.

Even with all three controlled, expect a handful of pixels to differ by one unit
in one channel — the compositor rounds gradients and anti-aliased edges. The tool
reports `max delta` so you can tell a rounding artifact (1–2) from a real change,
and only counts pixels beyond that tolerance.

If a view still reports a difference, capture it *in isolation* before believing
it. Differences that appear only partway through the scripted sequence have so
far always been sequencing artifacts rather than real regressions.

## Where this came from

This started as a single 3,679-line HTML file. `tools/split.py` is the one-time
migration that produced the current layout; it reads the original file (the
first commit on this branch) and regenerates `css/`, `js/`, and `index.html`.
It is kept for provenance — day-to-day work happens in the split files.

## Known seams

- **Player data is embedded.** `js/data/nfl-players.js` holds ~900 players as a
  pipe-delimited string. That is the natural place to swap in a real feed.
- **Everything is on `window`.** Faithful to the original, but the surface is
  wider than it needs to be; narrowing it to an explicit handler list is the
  obvious next cleanup.
- **Scores are seeded hashes**, not real stats — deterministic per player/week.
