# City Boys Dynasty

Fantasy football league app prototype — matchups, standings, rosters, a mock
draft room, free agency, and a simulated live-scoring week clock.

## Running it

The app is plain ES modules, so it needs to be served over HTTP (opening
`index.html` from the filesystem will not work — the browser blocks module
loading over `file://`).

```
npm start          # serves the repo at http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

No build step, no framework, no runtime dependencies.

## Layout

```
index.html      markup only
css/            one stylesheet per screen area, linked in cascade order
js/
  main.js       entry point: module order, window bridge, boot sequence
  state.js      the handful of values shared across modules
  store.js      localStorage persistence, roster rows, image downscaling
  data/         teams, league config, and the NFL player/schedule tables
  *.js          one module per screen or subsystem
tools/          dev server and the verification harness
```

### How startup works

`js/main.js` imports every module in the order the original single-file script
ran them, then copies their exports onto `window` — the markup drives the app
through inline `onclick="..."` handlers, which resolve against the global scope.

Modules do no work at import time. Anything that used to run at the top level
(seeding the store, applying league defaults, painting the sidebar rail) now
lives in an `init*` function that `main.js` calls in order. This matters:
ES modules evaluate depth-first over the import graph, which does *not* match
source order, and the original code depended on source order.

### `js/state.js`

Nine values are rebound from a module other than the one that declared them.
An imported binding is read-only in ES modules, so those live as properties on
a single exported `S` object. Everything else stays module-local.

## Verifying changes

The app is deterministic — no `Math.random`, no `Date.now` — so it can be
diffed against itself exactly.

```
npm start                                     # in one shell
npm run snapshot                              # dumps DOM for 32 interactions
node tools/pixel-diff.mjs <url-a> <url-b>     # screenshot comparison
```

`tools/snapshot.mjs` drives the app through every view and writes the resulting
DOM to one file per step. Diff two runs to see exactly what a change altered.

Note that `pixel-diff` is timing-sensitive: the live-score dot pulses on a 1.8s
loop and toasts are timer-driven, so it freezes animations and hides the toast
before capturing. Treat a lone differing view as suspect before treating it as
a regression.

## Where this came from

This started as a single 3,679-line HTML file. `tools/split.py` is the one-time
migration that produced the current layout; it reads the original file (the
first commit on this branch) and regenerates `css/`, `js/`, and `index.html`.
It is kept for provenance — day-to-day work happens in the split files.

## Known seams

- **Player data is embedded.** `js/data/nfl-players.js` holds ~900 players as a
  pipe-delimited string. That is the natural place to swap in a real feed.
- **Everything is on `window`.** Faithful to the original, but the surface is
  wider than it needs to be; narrowing it to an explicit handler list is the
  obvious next cleanup.
- **Scores are seeded hashes**, not real stats — deterministic per player/week.
